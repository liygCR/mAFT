Description: This package developed a two-stage procedure for simultaneously detecting multiple thresholds and achieving model selection in the segmented accelerate failure time (AFT) model. In the first stage, the threshold problem is formulated as a group model selection problem so that a concave 2-norm group selection method can be applied. In the second stage, the thresholds are finalized via a refining method.
